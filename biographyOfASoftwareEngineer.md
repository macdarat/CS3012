### Overview

Yukihiro Matsumoto, commonly known as *"Matz"*, is a Japanese software engineer. He was born on the 14th of April, 1965 in Osaka Prefecture. He is mostly known for creating the popular programming language Ruby. He is also responsible for creating Matz's Ruby Interpreter.  He has also authored several books, mostly focussing on the Ruby language. He is a Mormon, and has a wife and four children. [source](https://www.mormon.org/matz)

### Early Life

When Matz was young, he had a great interest in programming languages. He hoped to perhaps design one of his own someday. He studied computer science at Tsukuba University after he all ready begun programming in high school. Before university, his programming skills were entirely self taught.

### Before Ruby

Before Ruby, Matz worked on some other different open source projects. He worked for netlab.jp, an open source company. One of his projects was cmail, an email program based on emacs. Most of these projects are little known outside of Japan. It wasn't until the first release of Ruby that his work began to be noticed overseas.

>"I was talking with my colleague about the possibility of an object-oriented scripting language. I knew Perl (Perl4, not Perl5), but I didn't like it really, because it had the smell of a toy language (it still has). The object-oriented language seemed very promising. I knew Python then. But I didn't like it, because I didn't think it was a true object-oriented language — OO features appeared to be add-on to the language. As a language maniac and OO fan for 15 years, I really wanted a genuine object-oriented, easy-to-use scripting language. I looked for but couldn't find one. So I decided to make it."
[-Matz, talking on the Ruby mailing list in 1999](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/FAQ/FAQ.html)

### Ruby

Ruby itself was designed as a mixture of some of Matz's favourite languages, which included Perl, Ada and Lisp, among others. When designing the syntax for Ruby, Matz tried examining parts of languages such as these to create his preferred syntax. The result was the highly portable Ruby programming language, in which everything is an object. It has a dynamic, duck typing system, and supports object oriented, imperative and functional paradigms.

Ruby is designed with the programmer in mind, rather than the machine. This concept of putting programmer productivity and satisfaction ahead of code efficiency was quite revolutionary at the time of Ruby's first release.

>" Because computers don't mind if I must make effort to communicate with them or if it is easy to communicate with them. They don't care if I put the numbers of instruction byte sequences in a file and feed it to them to run, or if a very high level language generated the instructions. The computers don't care. We humans care about the effort we pay. Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, "By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves."[-Matz, talking about the design philosophy behind the Ruby language](http://www.artima.com/intv/ruby4.html)

Ruby's first release was in the year 1995 (ruby-0.95). Ruby 1.0 released was then released in December 1996. The Japanese Ruby community began to grow. Programmers and designers there who don't understand English are big fans. In 1999,  Matz co authors the first Ruby book with a colleague. In the early 2000s Ruby began to grow big outside of Japan. Later, the web development framework Ruby on Rails would lead to Matz's language becomming extremely popular. Even this website, Github, was [designed using Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#GitHub). Matz continues to lead work on the Ruby language to this day.

### Present

Matz would later be appointed to the position of chief architect for Ruby at the cloud platform Heroku. [Heroku source.](https://blog.heroku.com/matz_joins_heroku) Matz saw this as an opportunity to help with the deployment of Ruby applications. In an interview with SiliconAngle soon afterward, Matz had some thoughts on what is important to the success of an open source project.

>"Unlike the technical aspect of building software, community is about human relationships. Some developers don’t like this part, but sometimes the human relationships are important. In fact, they’re often the MOST important part of a project.

Both Matz's design philosophy and the Ruby programming language itself would go on to influence more software engineers and programming language designers. Some of the languages influenced by Ruby include D and CoffeeScript. [source](http://coffeescript.org/#operators)
