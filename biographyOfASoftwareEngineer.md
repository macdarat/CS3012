# Biography of Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, the creator of Ruby

Yukihiro Matsumoto, commonly known as *Matz*, is a Japanese software engineer. He was born on the 14th of April, 1965 in Osaka Prefecture. He is mostly known for creating the popular programming language Ruby. He is also responsible for creating Matz's Ruby Interpreter.  He has also authored several books, mostly focussing on the Ruby language.

When Matz was young, he had a great interest in programming languages. He hoped to perhaps design one of his own someday. He studied computer science at Tsukuba University after he all ready begun programming in high school. Before university, his programming skills were entirely self taught.

Before Ruby, Matz worked on some other different open source projects. He worked for netlab.jp, an open source company. One of his projects was cmail, an email program based on emacs. Most of these projects are little known outside of Japan. It wasn't until the first release of Ruby that his work began to be noticed overseas.

Ruby itself was designed as a mixture of some of Matz's favourite languages, which included Perl, Ada and Lisp, among others. When designing the syntax for Ruby, Matz tried examining parts of languages such as these to create his preferred syntax. The result was the highly portable Ruby programming language, in which everything is an object. It has a dynamic, duck typing system, and supports object oriented, imperative and functional paradigms.

>"I was talking with my colleague about the possibility of an object-oriented scripting language. I knew Perl (Perl4, not Perl5), but I didn't like it really, because it had the smell of a toy language (it still has). The object-oriented language seemed very promising. I knew Python then. But I didn't like it, because I didn't think it was a true object-oriented language â€” OO features appeared to be add-on to the language. As a language maniac and OO fan for 15 years, I really wanted a genuine object-oriented, easy-to-use scripting language. I looked for but couldn't find one. So I decided to make it."
