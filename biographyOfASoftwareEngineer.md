# Biography of Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, the creator of Ruby

Yukihiro Matsumoto, commonly known as *Matz*, is a Japanese software engineer. He is mostly known for creating the popular programming language Ruby. He is also responsible for creating Matz's Ruby Interpreter.

When Matz was young, he had a great interest in programming languages. He hoped to perhaps design one of his own someday. He studied computer science at Tsukuba University after he all ready begun programming in high school. Before university, his programming skills were entirely self taught.

Before Ruby, Matz worked on some other different open source projects. 
Ruby itself was designed as a mixture of some of Matz's favourite languages, which included Perl, Ada and Lisp, among others. When designing the syntax for Ruby, Matz tried examining parts of languages such as these to create his preferred syntax. The result was the highly portable Ruby programming language, in which everything is an object.
